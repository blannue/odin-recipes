        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring 
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.

            <li>Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. 
                Sprinkle about 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.</li>
            <li>Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir 
                into pasta mixture.</li>
            <li>Whisk milk and condensed soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir 
                into pasta mixture.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle remaining cheese over pasta mixture; garnish with paprika.</li>
            <li>Cook on Low for 3 hours, checking the edges are not getting too brown 
                after 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
