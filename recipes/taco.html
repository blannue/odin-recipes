    <h4>My favorite comfort food has to be tacos. But at times I feel
        a bit guilty munching on my beloved comfort food. That's why 
        I just had to make a variant of this amazing dish that's both
        tasty and healthier than a traditional taco.</h4>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>1lb 99%/1% Ground Turkey</li>
            <li>Old El Paso Carb Advantage Taco Shells</li>
            <li>Taco Bell Reduced Sodium Seasoning Mix</li>
            <li>Kraft No Fat Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>Daisy No Fat Sour Cream</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Set desired burner to "medium-high." Grab
                designated pan and brown ground turkey.</li>
            <li>Change burner heat from "medium-high" to "medium-low.</li>
            <strong>- While you do this step, preheat oven to 300Â°F.</strong>
            <li>Add 3/4 cup of water to pan.</li>
            <li>Add Taco Bell Seasoning Mix and stir.</li>
            <li>Grab lid and cover pan for 10 minutes, stirring periodically.</li>
            <li>Once your oven is preheated, grab a baking pan and put desired
                amount of taco shells on pan. Put it in the oven for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grab your desired condiments and fixings; in this recipe, I opted for
                "Kraft No Fat Shredded Cheese" and "Daisy No Fat Sour Cream."
            <li>Once completed, take your pan off the burner.</li>
            <li>Take taco shells out of oven, let them sit for a minute or two to cool.</li>
            <li>Grab a spatula. Scoop a serving of your finished taco meat in a taco shell
                and add the fixings listed in the "Ingredients" portion of this page.</li>
            <li>Last but most important step: enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
